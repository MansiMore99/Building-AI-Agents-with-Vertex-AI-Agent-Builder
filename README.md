## 2. Designing Your First AI Agent

Before you write a single line of code, clarify **who** your agent is and **what** it should do:

- **Persona**: Friendly support rep? Expert consultant?  
- **Scope**: Answer FAQs, troubleshoot issues, or guide workflows?  
- **Data Sources**: In‑house docs, external APIs, vector stores?  

Keep it focused—start small, then iterate!

## 3. Agent Mode Spotlight

Check out the hot new **Agent Mode** launch at Google I/O 2025: a super‑assistant that tackles multi‑step tasks on your behalf!  
- Apartment hunting? 🏠 It filters listings, schedules viewings, even negotiates tours.  
- Dinner planning? 🍽️ It suggests recipes, builds shopping lists, and orders groceries.  
- Trip planning? ✈️ It crafts day‑by‑day itineraries, books hotels, and finds hidden gems.  

Think of Agent Mode as your always‑on, proactive AI sidekick—ready to handle complex workflows so you can focus on the fun parts!

## 4. Step-by-Step Codelab

We’ve documented **every** step in Google’s official codelab. Follow along, then drop us a line if you have questions:

## 5. Data Store Setup

We’ve added a sample `wakanda.txt` in the **Data** folder. To hook it into your agent:

1. Click **Create new data store** in the Vertex AI console.  
2. Upload `wakanda.txt` to your Cloud Storage bucket.  
3. Point your Agent Builder to that bucket—now your agent can reference the text!

```text
Repository/Data/wakanda.txt
```
