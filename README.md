## 1. Before You Begin

This self‚Äëpaced codelab walks you through building AI Agents with Google Cloud‚Äôs Vertex AI Agent Builder. Each step shines a spotlight on a key Agent Builder feature and explains its role.

### Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of [Generative AI on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/ai/generative-ai?hl=en)
- Fundamental understanding of [AI Agent concepts](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/playbook)  
- Experience with [Gemini CodeAssist](https://codeassist.google/products/business)

### What You‚Äôll Learn

- Create a simple AI Agent using Vertex AI Agent Builder  
- Ground your agent with a managed datastore  
- (Optional) Embed your Agent into a web app  

### What You‚Äôll Need

- A curious mind üß†  
- A computer with stable internet üíª  
- A Google Cloud project with billing enabled (or Free Tier eligible)

## 2. Designing Your First AI Agent

Before you write a single line of code, clarify **who** your agent is and **what** it should do:

- **Persona**: Friendly support rep? Expert consultant?  
- **Scope**: Answer FAQs, troubleshoot issues, or guide workflows?  
- **Data Sources**: In‚Äëhouse docs, external APIs, vector stores?  

Keep it focused‚Äîstart small, then iterate!

## 3. Agent Mode Spotlight

Check out the hot new **Agent Mode** launch at Google I/O 2025: a super‚Äëassistant that tackles multi‚Äëstep tasks on your behalf!  
- Apartment hunting? üè† It filters listings, schedules viewings, even negotiates tours.  
- Dinner planning? üçΩÔ∏è It suggests recipes, builds shopping lists, and orders groceries.  
- Trip planning? ‚úàÔ∏è It crafts day‚Äëby‚Äëday itineraries, books hotels, and finds hidden gems.  

Think of Agent Mode as your always‚Äëon, proactive AI sidekick‚Äîready to handle complex workflows so you can focus on the fun parts!

## 4. Step-by-Step Codelab

We‚Äôve documented **every** step in Google‚Äôs official codelab. Follow along, then drop us a line if you have questions:

## 5. Data Store Setup

We‚Äôve added a sample `wakanda.txt` in the **Data** folder. To hook it into your agent:

1. Click **Create new data store** in the Vertex AI console.  
2. Upload `wakanda.txt` to your Cloud Storage bucket.  
3. Point your Agent Builder to that bucket‚Äînow your agent can reference the text!

```text
Repository/Data/wakanda.txt
```
